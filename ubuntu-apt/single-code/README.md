# ubuntu-apt

This folder contains singularity images for Quantum ESPRESSO
obtained via Ubuntu's `apt-get` command, rather than directly built.
Moreover, contains a version specific for each given code (not all are supported, as this is quite redundant) so that just running ./image.sif runs the actual code.
